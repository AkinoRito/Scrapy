cryptobach*1 month ago*9*What is MATRIX?MATRIX  is an open-source blockchain that supports smart contracts and machine  learning services. With its infrastructure re-built with artificial  intelligence (AI) techniques, MATRIX revolutionizes the user experience  of executing smart contracts by making the whole process faster, easier,  and safer. MATRIX offers breakthrough technologies in building highly  flexible blockchain networks, which support adaptive self-optimization  and multi-chain collaboration. In addition to refactoring the blockchain  with AI, MATRIX also allows its mining power to be used AI based big  data applicationsWhat is the ticker?MANWhat is the coin used for?A perfect answer to this question can be found in an article by the CEO hereWhere can I store MAN?MAN  is ERC-20 for now until the mainnet is launched, you can store it in  any ERC20 compatible wallets. MyEtherWallet is recommended.How do I see MAN in MyEtherWallet?You have to add it as a custom token. Steps:Press “Add token” and enter following details:Token contract address:0xe25bCec5D3801cE3a794079BF94adF1B8cCD802DToken Symbol: MANDigits: 18Within a few seconds you should be able to see your MAN token balance in your Ethereum wallet.When is the MAN native blockchain expected to launch?The  MATRIX blockchain is aiming to launch in Q3 2018 - September. MATRIX  will also release a number of demo and beta applications on Ethereum in  the meantime for their partners to make use of.I heard about an additional token sale?A  portion of the non-circulating supply is currently reserved to be used  in a second token sale to fund the hardware development and manufacture  for the bayesian mining machines in Q3 2019.What are main features of MATRIX?Thanks to fast-growing AI technologies, MATRIX offers unique features as follows.EASIER: Allowing everybody to design smart contracts without explicit programming skills.SAFER: Making blockchains more robust under malicious attacks.FASTER: Enabling faster transactions and higher processing throughput.MORE FLEXIBLE: Seamless integration of public and private chains with the capability of adaptive optimization.No programming? How?In  addition to writing smart contracts in the same way as programmers  would on other blockchains, the unique code generation technique of  MATRIX allows automatic conversion of an abstract description of the  contract into an executable program.MATRIX  only asks the users to input the core elements (input, output, trigger  conditions). Then the neural network will automatically generate the  code to convert the script into the equivalent program.Isn't that impossible? /u/xyz said that its a lie and can't be done, because program synthesis "isn't possible".xxxxxx,Nice  to know you're so familiar with our proposal. In our blockchain, a user  defines their intention with a natural language, but the respective  smart contract is still a program in a programming language. We provide  tools for the conversion from an intention to a program.The  general problem of generating programs from natural language is  certainly a hard one. Microsoft's deepcoder project illustrates the  possibility to generate program from an algorithmic description with  deep learning techniques, but it's still far from mature. On the other  hand, programs for smart contracts are much more restricted in terms of  underlying programming patterns. Our analysis on existing Ethereum code  reveals that these programs can be covered by ~60 programming patterns.  Therefore, our idea is actually simple:A  user defines their contract intention with a natural language  (currently English and Chinese) in either spoken or written form.A deep learning based procedure extracts the underlying patterns of transaction.A  library (which is constructed in advance) based procedure is used to  generate the program by composing code for each pattern from snippets in  the librarySo you are  correct. A user says something like "Send X MAN to Y address on  condition Z", which is the simplest pattern, is one of them. It is then  straightforward to generate the code for such a behavior.YangdongFormal smart contract code security verification? How?There  are 4 main parts to the formal contract security verification, they can  each be read about in detail in the technical whitepaper. MATRIX has  generative adversarial network based security and distributed  concurrence-based dynamic model verification. Essentially this means  that before smart contracts are deployed to the network, they are  attacked by AI generated hacker programs which target vulnerabilities  and loopholes in the code in a sandbox environment. The neural network  that the code is based on is already being trained on the ERC-20  contracts on the Ethereum network.What is MATRIX's consensus mechanism?MATRIX  adopts a unique hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism. The PoW is  performed in a significantly smaller network of delegates, which are  selected with a random distributed voting algorithm. The probability of a  node to be selected is proportional to its PoS. The “winner” delegate  shares the PoW reward with other nodes in its cluster. This mechanism  eliminates the latency issues associated with scaling commonly faced by  other blockchains.Does MATRIX need mining?Yes,  MATRIX adopts a hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism and requires  mining for the PoW part. The mining computing of MATRIX is not the  commonly used Hash functions, which do not have added values outside the  scope of cryptocurrency. Instead, MATRIX adopts the Markov Chain Monte  Carlo (MCMC), a Bayesian computing pattern, as the mining function.  Since MCMC has wide applications in scientific and industry domains, the  PoW computing can be treated as crowdsourcing for such applications.What is the total supply of MAN?There  can be 1,000,000,000 MAN ever. 15% of the maximum supply was sold in  ICO, and 10% is with the foundation for business and community  development and will not go directly to market. 25% of tokens are  created currently. The rest, 75%, is broken down as 40% is for mining  and 35% is for community, hardware development, team. It will take  decades for the max amount of tokens to reach circulation. There is a  lock period of 2 years on the team tokens.What is the circulating supply of MAN?The  circulating supply is approximately 150,000,000 MAN. There is also  100,000,000 that the foundation has unlocked, however, foundation tokens  are omitted from CoinMarketCap's circulating supply definition.What is MATRIX's connection to the Belt and Road Initiative?MATRIX's  head of business ecology/partnerships is Executive Projects Expert for  the state-owned Belt and Road Research and Development Center. MATRIX  are the exclusive blockchain partner and the exclusive AI partner for  the center and all blockchain related Belt and Road contracts and  projects via the center go to MATRIX.What is the connection between MATRIX and Alibaba Group?There  is no direct connection between MATRIX and Alibaba. One of MATRIX's  angel investors is F&H, a fund which is founded and directly managed  by John Wu, former CTO of the Alibaba Group.How did MATRIX have an ICO if ICOs are banned in China?The  MATRIX project is governed and supervised by the MATRIX Foundation. The  foundation is registered in Hong Kong, not China. The Foundation has  separate departments to manage various aspects of the development and  operations of MATRIX. The law firm, ReedSmith Richards Butler is the  legal advisor to the Foundation.Who is in the the foundation?The  Foundation was founded by the following three persons who are also  currently advisors of the Foundation to the MATRIX team and MATRIX  Blockchain:Michael Lai-Yick NgMichael  co-founded Legend Holdings group (now known as Lenovo Group Limited,  HKSE Stock Code: 992) in 1988 and Asia Online Limited in 1993. In 2000,  he founded North 22 Technology Services Group. As an IT and Internet  veteran, Mr. Ng has over 35 years of experience in the technology sector  in Greater China.Benedict TaiMr.  Tai is a retired partner of a major US law firm with over 30 years of  experience specializing in cross-border corporate finance. He was also  an investment banker with Lehman Brothers specializing in TMT. He was  one of the founders of Latitude Capital, a boutique merchant bank with  offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. He is a member of the New  York Bar Association and a member of the Hong Kong Law Society.Ignatius Cheng Kwok-LapIgnatius  Cheng was the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and Company Secretary of  Legend Holdings Limited (now known as Lenovo Group Limited, HKSE Stock  Code: 992) in 1988. In 2002, he founded InnoState Holdings Limited,  which is a private equity investment company. Ignatius Cheng is a fellow  member of The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, United  Kingdom and an associate member of The Hong Kong Institute of Certified  Public Accountants.How can I be sure of MATRIX's AI competency?These are a good starting point:https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/WhitePaper/blob/master/MATRIXLab/aaai18_camera.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/papers/blob/master/ASPLOS'18.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/WhitePaper/blob/master/MATRIXLab/Hypergraph4driving.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/papers/blob/master/TCAD%E2%80%9816.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/Deep-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/2-CNN%20Primer.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/Talks/blob/master/From%20High%20Speed%20Train%20to%20Bayesian%20Network.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/Talks/blob/master/Stochastic%20Bayesian%20Computing.pdf https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/Talks/blob/master/Embedded%20Deep%20Learning.pdfAside from the leadership team and the foundation, who else is in the MATRIX team?MATRIX  has 25 engineers, 5 more to be on-boarded at the time of writing, from a  range of Alibaba, Microsoft, Facebook, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Tsinghua,  TU Munich (best school in Germany), Face++, Huawei and more. --Threads you should readIntro to MATRIX presentation by Dr DengDetails  about their Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Solution in partnership with  the National Health and Welfare Commission and various hospitalsSome of Dr Deng's books, resume, some presentations, and various award winning papers Research about Dr Li - He is technical director for one of the Chinese Government's "Major 5G IOT projects" currentlyConfirmation of Cybernaut VC investment and intro to Cybernaut (huge)Head  of Partnerships John Zhu advising the deputy head of the Central  Political and Legal Commission on a new Belt and Road project

pukis3891*7 hours ago*1*Вероятно, вы все уже знаете, что профессор Стив Денг в интервью Crypto Lark упомянул участие MATRIX в одном из первых городов проекта OBOR - Чунцин. Если MAN успешно выполнит все задачи, это может стать огромным скачком для проекта и oдобрением со стороны Китая. На мой взгляд, это может привести к массовому внедрению MAN в OBOR.

turboblockchain*2 days ago*5*There has been a lot of fud, fear mongering and general curiosity regarding the transfer of 8 million MAN tokens sent to 2 addresses. One that happened to be that of Huobi. Now, I do not know why those tokens were moved, but I wanted to clarify that those tokens HAVE NOT BEEN SOLD. The 3 million man were not sent to huobi. They are sitting in this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf42647b2bdaa01f6ce41fb01eeb720bc01e8d6dThe 5 million sent to Huobi have not been sold as Huobi's matrix balance has not even changed. I checked Huobi's Matrix balance a few weeks ago and it is relatively the same. Maybe gone up 500,000 or so. https://etherscan.io/address/0xfdb16996831753d5331ff813c29a93c76834a0adIf I have any information in the future, I will keep the community updated. 
cryptobach*3 days ago*4*The concept of blockchain has been around for the past few years, but Matrix is attempting to further develop its capabilities by ushering in the next generation of blockchain technology. Some of Matrix's important features are:Intelligent Smart Contacts: Using nothing more than natural language and user intent, smart contracts are automatically generated through the use of Artificial Intelligence.Automated AI Security Auditing: Using Artificial Intelligence Matrix is able to automatically audit smart contracts for bugs and security holes.High Throughput: Using a unique POS/POW hybrid engine and proprietary hardware, MATRIX is aiming to achieve 1,000,000 transactions per second. Green Mining: MATRIX is the only blockchain to use a statistical modelling engine to go well beyond simple mining calculations. MATRIX’s model is able to compute statistical, probability and AI calculations all in a purposeful and eco friendly way.

cryptobach*5 days ago*7*A lot of times when the market is down like this a lot of discussion is centered among price discussion and as such we miss out on all the other things happening in the community. Over all of matrix's social media accounts there are over 100,000+ community members, and over 26,00 token holders, I can imagine that in the next year that number might double or even triple. It is exciting to see how the future of the project will unfold.

cryptobach*5 days ago*1*Многие люди не знают об этом важном партнерстве. Альянс ABCD, или «Альянс по развитию технологий искусственного интеллекта и  блокчейнa», был совместно спонсирован компанией Matrix 5 сентября 2017 года. Альянс является первым в своем роде и стремится стимулировать развитие интеграции ИИ (искусственного Интеллектa) и технологии блокчейн в Китае. В целом, альянс стремится «продвигать инновации для двух технологий, а также технологические инновации, коммерческие инновации и институциональные инновации в соответствующих областях, по мимо этово создавать платформу сотрудничества в области производства, исследования и исследований с функцией обмена технологиями, стандартами и интеллектуальными возможностями, правами собственности и внедрением новых технологий. Организации, связанные с альянсом, занимают должности, связанные с искусственным интеллектом и блокчейном. Кроме того, альянс получил дополнительную поддержку от различных экспертов ведущих университетов, таких как Университет Цинхуа и Университет Дьюка. Наконец, в поддержку альянса в университете Цинхуа была создана «первая вычислительная лаборатория, похожая на мозг», известная как «Лаборатория Байеса». Руководителем которого является доктор Дэн Янгдонг, профессор компьютерного программного обеспечения в Университете Цинхуа. Впоследствии также будет создан аналитический центр. B настоящее время профессорам, лабораториям и аспирантам Университета Цинхуа, Университета Чжэнцзян и Университета Ксидиан и руководителям некоторых компаний было предложено присоединиться к аналитическому центру и оказать поддержку.

pukis3891*8 days ago*13*just found the following and thought it was worth sharing​https://www.nvidia.com/object/professor_partners_bios_yangdong.html
pccoin7*9 days ago*2*Recently there has been some concern about the commits on github being "fake" or "overly basic".As  a result of the Matrix github being public and open, anyone can leave  commits on the master branch. This has resulted in community members  leaving commits, the "overly basic" commits were not left by someone  from inside the Matrix R&D Department.The Matrix R&D department  only uses a single account: matrixhaolin to make commits, any other commits are not from the Matrix team.Due  to this the Matrix team will will set/limit the controls/permissions  dictating who is allowed to leave commits on the Master branch. Other  branches will remain open.I hope this clarifies it and if you have any other questions or concerns please comment below.

AnarAchronist*10 days ago*9*On November 14, Beijing time, the 2018 China (Beijing) International Technology Transfer Conference, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government and hosted by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, was successfully opened at the National Convention Center. The three-day conference will hold a round-table forum on transnational technology transfer and regional innovation cooperation, focusing on the three main lines of “technology transfer factor integration (element), key country regional cooperation (country), and high-tech industry development (area)”. 11 parallel special events such as the International Innovation Capital Forum and the Artificial Intelligence Forum.As the chief artificial intelligence scientist of MATRIX, the initiator of the Matrix Digital Economic Think Tank, associate professor of Tsinghua University, and well-known artificial intelligence scholar Yangdong Deng was invited to attend the artificial intelligence special forum and delivered a keynote speech, focusing on the theme of “open innovation, win-win future”. Together with the well-known scholars and entrepreneurs present, they bring fresh academic sharing to the audience. The following is the content:Yangdong Deng said that with deep learning technology, machines can do better than people in things that people are good at. Especially after AlphaGo defeated humans for the first time in 2016, deep learning made an important breakthrough in the whole machine learning, and the best human brain could not compare with artificial intelligence. However, there is a characteristic of deep learning technology or AI technology, that is, the processing problem is very simple. These technologies are very specific. Each network and each tool solves a specific problem and cannot adapt to the change of the environment. This is called weak artificial intelligence.Yangdong Deng believes that artificial intelligence should be a kind of ability to change. Through an algorithm or a set of mechanisms, it can adapt and solve various problems. This is called strong artificial intelligence. His team is trying to make a machine that thinks like humans, designing the computational body structure that supports Bayesian computation from the bottom. At the same time, they add a random source to each unit. After the data passes through the random source, it can be coupled to one. Item classification, combined to produce an arbitrary distribution. On the other hand, Yangdong Deng uses probabilistic programming language, which is characterized by the improvement of the random probability distribution of each variable, rather than a simple fixed-valued variable, so it is compatible with Bayesian reasoning.Yangdong Deng finally said that the previously designed GPU open source platform was accelerated after the transformation, and the work of deep convolutional network was done with a GPU-like architecture. But in fact, a chip is not enough. Even if you can make a chip, you can simulate the function. You still need a lot of chips. The chip needs to be combined with different computing powers of the Blockchain. On this, we can do a lot of applications, such as doing a whole brain. Simulation, simulation of cognitive development processes, machines that think and learn like humans, this is called strong artificial intelligence, or general artificial intelligence.source: https://www.linksfin.com/article/196649
